# Splunk> SOAR

Welcome to the Splunk> SOAR Community! SOAR is Splunk's premier Security Automation, Orchestration, and Response ("SOAR") platform. With it, our customers can automate entire or partial workflows for their employees across an infinite number of use-cases.

This [GitHub organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-organizations) represents our efforts to open-source our SOAR Apps so our customers can look at how our code works, make improvements, and generally build a stronger community through the free exchange of ideas.

## Reporting Issues
If you've found a problem with an app but don't want to contribute a fix, that's ok! All you need to do is go to the [Issues](https://github.com/splunk-soar-apps/phawslambda/issues) section of the app repo and click 'New Issue'. This will show our conviniently set-up Issue templates. 

![Issues Templates](../.github/Images/Github-Issue-Templates.png)

All you have to do is fill out the form...

![Bug Report](../.github/Images/Github-Bug-Template.png) 

...and it'll get reviewed and priortized by our developers and maybe even someone in our community.

Of course before you do this, you should definitely check if there is already an open issue and if so, add a thumbs-up reaction to it so we can get a sense of how to prioritize it.
